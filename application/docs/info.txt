user arrives on landing page

1. create the link
2. send the link
3. user clicks the link
4. user arrives on landing page
5. user signs up
6. user account is credited

the links can be personalized
reporting to the user on 
  how many clicks
  how many signups

tiered rewwards - do we pass this to the client?
if not, then you need an action type and then business logic with the action
then you can customize the logic

no there is one share code
but the link somehow needs to know which landing page to go to
this would be a campain

if we use the point wallet, then you can redeem for whatever

so, given an email addres, the system generates a share code
